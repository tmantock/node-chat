# Node.js Chat

Node.js chat is a simple node.js and socket.io node application.

This application uses Express to initialize and create the server. Moment.js was used to format the timestamps in a readable form. Socket.io was used as the backbone for allowing the client and server to communicate.

Socket.io allows foe the client to send a message and for the server to determine who the message should go to.

This application features the ability to create private chat rooms.

There is also a command that allows users to see everyone who is currently in the room. Simply type @currentUsers and the list of current users will appear in a message to the user who requested it.

Bootstrap Paper was used to give the application it's flat design.
